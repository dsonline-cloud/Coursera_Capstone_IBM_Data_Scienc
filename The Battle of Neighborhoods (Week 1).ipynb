    "I am a data scientist residing in Downtown Los Angeles. I currently live within walking distance to Downtown metro station and I enjoy many ammenities and venues in the area, such as various international cousine restaurants, cafes, food shops and entertainment. I have been offered a great opportunity to work for a leader firm in Manhattan, NY. I am very excited and I want to use this opportunity to practice my learnings in Coursera in order to answer relevant questions arisen. The key question is \n",

    "#### How can I find a convenient and enjoyable place similar to mine now in Los Angeles? Certainly, I can use available real estate apps and Google but the idea is to use and apply myself the learned tools during the course. In order to make a comparison and evaluation of the rental options in Manhattan NY, I must set some basis, therefore the apartment in Manhattan must meet the following demands:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Apartment must be 2 or 3 bedrooms \n",
    "\n",
    "2. desired location is near a metro station in the Manhattan area and within 1.0 mile (1.6 km) radius \n",
    "\n",
    "3. price of rent not exceed 7000 dollars per month \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Top ammenities in the selected neighborhood shall be similar to current residence. \n",

    "5. Desirable to have venues such as coffee shops, restaurants Asian Thai, wine stores, gym and food."
